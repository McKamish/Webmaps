Module of Python course on Udemy.

Overall, the instructor walks you through the code.
I will try to do each step on my own, but ultimately this code is not of my own.
Wherever I am unable to figure it out, I'll get the code by watching the video.
And anywhere my code isn't as efficient, I'll likely change it to what is in the video (possibly with comments).
And, from the get-go, this project was chosen by the instructor.
